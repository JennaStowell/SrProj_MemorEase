**MemorEase:** A Learning and Retention Tool <br>

Learning Goals
- My first Full Stack Development Project (PERN)
- Project management over a set amount of time (a semester)

*Final Project*<br>
MemorEase was inspired by the pay wall implemented into the popular app Quizlet. In MemorEase, users can input their notes to create a study set. Within these study sets, users can use 3 different learning modes and a mini game to learn and retain.
